data source 

#Context
In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's like wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. for 10 minutes intervals. This file was taken from a wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey.

#Content
The data's in the file are:

-Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)

-LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment

-Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)

-Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer

-Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)


#predicting future unseen value:

in the dataset, the first date is 1st January 2018 and the last date is 30th March 2020. A new dataframe will be created for the period from 1st April to 1st June 2020, with data points at every 10-minute interval.
